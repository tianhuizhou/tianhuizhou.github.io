<h2 id="experience">What I learned</h2>
This is my first time to attend a group project. It's a great experience for me to learn working with people in a big project. It makes me realize that the significance of teamwork. My team is amazing because everyone has their own advantages for accomplishing the project, so we have a very good efficiency for doing the project.
I also practice my skills by using Meteor for UI design and database and learn how to develop a website. That's a great opportunity for me.
