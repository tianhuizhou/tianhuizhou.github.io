Developing computer science is to make our lives more convenient and efficient. People are smart because they always try to task reduplicate work to computer by implement techniques. People believe that they can save a lot of time by avoiding doing reduplicate work every day and create values by innovations and creations. Since today many things involve programming, we are easily to see many similar problems with occurred solutions. For software engineering, implementing proper design patterns in a program is important because it is more efficient and normative especially when we work with other people.

Learning the principle for each technique is important, so when I learn software engineering, I was required to code without any library to practice basic skills. Sometimes I need to code a lot for a simple webpage. Even some different functionalities have some similar parts, I do not have a standard way to handle them. However, as I am more familiar to the software engineering I learn to code a program at a standard approach by implementing proper design pattern. In the real work, implementing design pattern is very important for a teamwork. For example, I attend a group project for the course ICS 314, and we are using Meteor and implementing some design patterns for the base of the website. The first good thing is that we can quickly start to plan our project based on these design patterns we already implement because they provide some modules for us to explore ideas. We do not have to waste time in the very beginning to build up the base of the project. Furthermore, implementing mature design patterns provides a standard way to code our project. Having a standard of coding is important for group project because everyone might have different coding style and habits. Using design pattern can help us efficiently work with each member because it makes the code more readable and comprehensible.

Software design pattern means a reusable solution for a common problem, which can be implemented in many different situations and able to be extend by given requirements. It is one of the cornerstones for a project. Therefore, properly using design pattern is important for software engineering.
