  The reason why I take computer science major is I believe that learning computer science is the way to become a creative person. Personally, becoming a creative person means that I should have varied imagination in my life and fund of knowledge to support me for realizing my imagination. However, it’s impossible to realize all my imagination, and I need to analyze their feasibility before I start a project. Becoming a creative person is a long journey but learning software engineering is a good point to start the journey. 
  
	Software engineering plays an important role in our lives. People design different kind of software to help them improve their efficiencies for work. Software engineering makes live easy and convenient. For example, now we access our bank account online and do business that helps people save a lot of time. Even we can use Applepay and Paypal to finish payment by phone, and we do not really need to bring money. People design many software for make their lives easy, so they do not have to do same kinds of things over and over again. I am interested in the creativity of software engineering because that’s make me feel I am actually doing something for my life.   
	
	I hope I can develop my programming skill because being able to realize my ideas by programming is very important. If I have an amazing idea but I am not able to do realize it, that is nothing. Furthermore, I need to develop my skill of analysis problems because it influences my work efficiency. I should able to think about problems by different ways and choose the efficient way to do. In the future, I wish I can attend to develop a complete software, which is useful for people.
