  Since the Covid pandemic has huge impact to global human civilization, our lives have been changed in many ways. Many people lost their job, and many businesses have been shut down because of the virus. Students cannot go to school, and they have to take their courses online. we are live in the panic because our survival is threatened and we do not know that when we can back to the normal lives. In this specific period, we have changed our daily lives for facing the challenge from the Covid pandemic.
	
  Personally, the Covid pandemic does not have too much impact on my daily routine. Since I have a busy semester, my routine is taking care of my study. In this situation, I just study at home rather than school libraries. However, I lost my job due to the Covid pandemic, so I have more time can be spent on study. Basically, nothing different on my daily routine right now because I just change the place for studying. 
  
  Since we transfer to online tutoring for all courses after spring break, I realize that some courses are getting more difficult than usual. I used to take one or two online courses for every semester because I believe I can do well on these courses without in-person tutoring. Personally, I would never decide to take online courses for my major, which are relevant to ICS topics because in-person tutoring is very helpful for me to understand the course materials. Another reason is I want to be very serious for my major courses because in-person courses can keep engaging me. I feel the most difficult course I take in this semester is ICS 311 Algorithm, and it is getting harder due to only online tutoring. Personally, I like to take in-person for the course because I can easily ask questions and be answered immediately. The explanations from face-to-face are always clearer and more understandable than texts for me. 
  
  The good thing for me is that these difficulties do not hurt my enthusiasm about study. I still feel motivated to wake up and keep study every day. I believe that we all can defeat the virus and back to the normal lives in the future. Therefore, I need to do my best for my school and life before the day.
