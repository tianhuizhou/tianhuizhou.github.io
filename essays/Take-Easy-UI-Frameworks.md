UI Frameworks are very powerful tools, but they are complicated to learn as a brand new language for me. It’s very similar to importing a library or package and using its functions or features that are already written. Basically, we do not have to worry about how to realize the functionalities, and we can just use the corresponding structures or containers to make the draft the modify them to what we expect. I think using UI Frameworks is important for programmers because they save time and make easy for our work. Inside these UI Frameworks, they already wrapped many functionalities in different data structures. We can start with these existing functionalities and features in UI Frameworks when we build a website. Even if it does not come out exactly what we want, we still can revise it by using CSS. Therefore, we can quickly build a modern website by using some UI Frameworks rather than setting up parameters step by step. Furthermore, during the process of building a website, many elements or portion might have same features or functionalities, which means we might have to do many repeating works. If we do not have these UI Frameworks, we need to create some JS function or work in the CSS file. Therefore, this is a good thing to use UI Frameworks for programmers, so we do not actually write the code for these functions, and we just need to make a little change on it for matching what we expect.

	I think developing UI Frameworks is worth and important. Especially for some big company, having their own UI Frameworks might significant for them. UI Frameworks are not only providing convenience when programmers build projects, but also it is like a coding style for helping people understand each other’s work in a group. We can have many different ways to reach the same functionalities because we all have our own coding style and ideas. However, in group work, we will expect a constant way that most people have the same understanding to code. Therefore, we do not have to spend tons of time on explaining individual work. If everyone in a group use the same Frameworks, their codes will be more readable for each other and then reduce the risk of bugs.

	In my opinion, I think why we am learning computer science are making our lives more convenient and qualitied. We should avoid doing repeating things by ourselves during works, the repeating thing should be assigned to our computer. We should make our code work on most of time rather than few specific cases. That’s why we have many libraries, package and Frameworks can be imported when we need in work.
