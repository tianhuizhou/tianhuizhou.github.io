    I think Javascript is very convenient to programmers because it has some very useful and strong data structures. I learned Java, C, and C++ language in ICS 200+ level courses, also learned a little bit Python from Internet. Those language have very precise grammar, which means variables have to be clearly defined and sentences have to be very precise. However, Javascript is a scripting language that its grammar is clearer and shorter than Java, C, and C++, and It actually reduce a lot of work for programmers. I feel its grammar and some feature of data structure are very similar to Python. Furthermore, some data structures in Javascripts are different and better than other languages I learned. For example, the array in Javascripts can store different types of variables, which means array in Javascripts does not have a consistent type anymore. An array in Javascripts can store an integer number while input a string. That is a very strong and convenient feature for programmers. Therefore, I think Javascript is a good programming language for software engineers because it actually makes our work easy. However, different languages have their features and advantages, so itâ€™s hard to give a precise answer for which one is a better language. It depends on what kinds of work the programmers do.
    
    
   Personally, I really like the way of practice WODs because practice can help me improve my programming skills. I think the purpose of learning different skills or principles is to solve problems. Doing practice WODs can help me connect a math or real problem in my life with programming. And setting up the timer for doing practice WODs is a good idea for improving my efficiency. It can cause some stress for me because I feel uncomfortable about working in the situation. However, stress is necessary because it might force me to explore my full potential. Furthermore, learning how to work under the pressure is important for my future because it may happen many time in my career.
